* Display the field names in the table headings
* Clicking on the table column headings should allow for bi-directional sorting.
* Implement a column filter (UI is up to you) (I need to be able to select which columns I want to see in the table. For example, I may not want to see the latitude and longitude all the time)
* Implement a data filter (text field)
* Enable key based filtering (example: prefixed with "company:" will only filter based on company values)
* Filter on all columns, not just the currently displayed columns
